This directory contains BDD variable orders for several circuits.
The orders are the best that CUDD has produced over time. For the
small circuits (less than 20 variables) the orders are optimal. For
some other circuits they are likely to be optimal. For many others
there should be room for improvement.

The format of the order files is simply a list of the primary input
and present state variable names, separated by whitespace. A summary
table is also included, which gives for each circuit the size of the
BDDs and the time it took to build the BDDs (once the order was
given). The sizes are for BDDs with complement arcs and include the
constant node.

I make these order available in the hope that they will help further
research on BDDs. First of all, these orders should provide a sanity
check by allowing one to compare sizes. Second, for people researching
variable ordering these orders provide a reference point to judge the
effectiveness of heuristics. Finally, for BDD-based applications not
directly concerned with variable ordering, these orders may represent
a convenient way to quickly get meaningful results.

I've tried to make sure the orders are correct. If that's not the
case, I'd appreciate your feedback (Fabio@Colorado.EDU).
Not all circuits for which orders are included are in the public
domain. I've included the orders nonetheless, because I'm not the only
one who has copies of those circuits, but I cannot redistribute the circuits.
On the other hand, a few circuits that I personally described are freely
available and I've prepared a tar file with the blif files. (They are
mostly arithmetic circuits.)

Enjoy.
